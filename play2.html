        <h2>A Woman of no Importance</h2>
        <h4>ACT III.  The Hall at Hunstanton Chase</h4>
        <p>


            <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> I don’t think that England should be represented abroad
by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.</p>

<h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>. <p class="speech"> You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too
nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he
would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too
large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She
was made to be an ambassador’s wife.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>.  <p class="speech">She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
people’s names, and forgetting their faces.</p>

<h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>.  <p class="speech">Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To
Footman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to
your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she
really must come to dinner.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Exit Footman_.]</p>

<h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>. <p class="speech"> That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]
Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?</p>

<h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech">With pleasure. <p class="stage-direction"> [_Exit with_ GERALD.]</p></p>

<h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6>.  <p class="speech">I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good
fortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased
that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord
without my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I
remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,
because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.
It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in
any respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to
get rid of her.</p>
