    <h4>ACT III.  The Hall at Hunstanton Chase</h4>
    <p style="white-space: pre">

        <p class="stage-direction"> [SIR JOHN and LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
        large yew tree_.] </p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="speech"> I believe this is the first English country house you
        have stayed at, Miss Worsley? </p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="speech"> You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6> <p class="speech"> We have not many.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech">Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="stage-direction">[Smiling.] </p> <p class="speech"> We have the largest country in the world, Lady
        Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
        big as France and England put together. </p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6> <p class="speech">Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
        <p class="stage-direction">[To SIR JOHN.] </p> John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
        my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name SIRJOHN"> SIR JOHN. </h6> <p class="speech">I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>.  <p class="speech">I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
        charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
        damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
        little lax about the people she asks down here. <p class="stage-direction"> [To SIR JOHN.] </p> Jane
        mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
        distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
        Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
        
        <h6 class="name SIRJOHN"> SIR JOHN. </h6>. <p class="speech"> Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
        name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
        man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>.  <p class="speech">I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
        yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
        invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
        Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
        was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
        believe she ran away more than once.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>.  <p class="speech">Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady
        Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to
        have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is
        right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,
        one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not
        considered the thing.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> In America those are the people we respect most.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> I have no doubt of it.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so
        sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
        across.  It is a privilege to meet him.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>.<p class="speech">  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
        lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
        English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They
        show them then.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
        man and a young girl?</p>
        
        <p class="stage-direction"> [Enter LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
        cushion_.] </p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying
        what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful
        power of selection.  It is quite a gift.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit
        in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will
        carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To
        Footman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.
        Get the Shetland. <p class="stage-direction"></p>[Exit Footman for shawl.]</p></p>
        
        <p class="stage-direction"> [Enter GERALD ARBUTHNOT.] </p>
        
        <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6> <p class="speech"> Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord
        Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>. <p class="speech"> His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It
        means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be
        delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
        Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to
        go anywhere.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
        Illingworth had made me such an offer.</p>
        
        <p class="stage-direction"> [Enter Footman with shawl.]</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
        up and meet him. <p class="stage-direction"> [To Footman.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes
        letter_.]</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>. <p class="speech"> That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
        you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>.  <p class="speech">It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show
        myself worthy of it.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE. </h6>.<p class="speech">  I trust so.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>.  <p class="stage-direction">[To HESTER.] </p> <p class="speech">You have not congratulated me yet, Miss
        Worsley.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Are you very pleased about it?</p>
        
        <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out
        of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>. <p class="speech"> Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.</p>
        
        <h6 class="name LADY HUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>. <p class="speech"> I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
        Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that
        may not be true.</p>
